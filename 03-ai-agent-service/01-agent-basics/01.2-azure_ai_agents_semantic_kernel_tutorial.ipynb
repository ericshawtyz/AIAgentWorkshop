    "\n",
    "Think of Azure AI Agents with Semantic Kernel as your **AI-powered assistants** that can:\n",
    "- Have conversations with users\n",
    "- Remember what was discussed (through \"threads\")\n",
    "- Use plugins and tools to extend their capabilities\n",
    "- Maintain context across multiple interactions\n",
    "- Leverage the power of Semantic Kernel's orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts (Don't worry, we'll see these in action!):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent**: Your AI assistant powered by Azure AI and orchestrated by Semantic Kernel\n",
    "- **Thread**: A conversation session (like a chat conversation)\n",
    "- **Message**: Individual messages within a conversation\n",
    "- **Plugin**: Additional capabilities your agent can use (like calling APIs or processing data)\n",
    "- **Client**: The connection to Azure AI services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Semantic Kernel?\n",
    "- **Rich Plugin System**: Easily extend agent capabilities\n",
    "- **Async Support**: Better performance for real-world applications\n",
    "- **Enterprise Ready**: Built for production scenarios\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform**: Works across different platforms and languages\n",
