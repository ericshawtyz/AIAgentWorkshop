    "## 🧠 What is the Python `with` Statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement is Python's way of handling **context management**. Think of it as an automatic \"setup and cleanup\" mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 What happens with `with`:\n",
    "1. **Enter**: Resources are set up (connections opened, credentials loaded)\n",
    "2. **Work**: Your code runs inside the `with` block\n",
    "3. **Exit**: Resources are automatically cleaned up (connections closed, credentials disposed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Benefits:\n",
    "- **Automatic cleanup**: No need to remember to close connections\n",
    "- **Exception safety**: Cleanup happens even if errors occur\n",
    "- **Cleaner code**: Less boilerplate, more readable\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Perfect for:\n",
    "- Database connections\n",
    "- File operations\n",
    "- API clients (like Azure AI Agents!)\n",
    "- Any resource that needs cleanup\n",

    "### 🎯 **Golden Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Default to `with`**: Use it unless you have a specific reason not to\n",
    "2. **Match your pattern**: \n",
    "   - Script/utility → Use `with`\n",
    "   - Long-lived app → Manual management\n",
    "3. **Handle exceptions**: Always cleanup, even when errors occur\n",
    "4. **Async awareness**: Use `async with` for async code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **Quick Decision Guide:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself**: *\"Does my client lifetime match this code block?\"*\n",
    "- **Yes** → Use `with` ✅\n",
    "- **No** → Manual management ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Performance Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reuse clients** when possible (expensive to create)\n",
    "- **Use connection pooling** for high-throughput scenarios  \n",
    "- **Monitor resource usage** to catch leaks early\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Remember:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement isn't just about cleanup—it's about **writing more reliable, maintainable code**. When in doubt, use `with`! 🎉"

    "### ✅ **What You've Learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context managers**: What they are and why they matter\n",
    "- **Foundry SDK patterns**: Both `with` and manual approaches\n",
    "- **Semantic Kernel patterns**: Async context management\n",
    "- **Decision making**: When to use each approach\n",
    "- **Best practices**: Writing reliable, maintainable code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply these patterns in your own projects\n",
    "- Experiment with long-lived vs short-lived client scenarios\n",
    "- Explore advanced context management patterns\n",
    "- Check out Azure AI Agents function calling and streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Key Takeaway:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use `with` by default** for cleaner, safer code. Only manage resources manually when you have a specific architectural need.\n",
