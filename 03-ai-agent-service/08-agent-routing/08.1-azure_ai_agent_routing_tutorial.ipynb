    "\n",
    "**Agent Routing** allows you to create intelligent systems where:\n",
    "- **Specialized agents** handle specific tasks (data retrieval, analysis, etc.)\n",
    "- **Router agents** decide which specialist to use\n",
    "- **Hierarchical organization** enables complex workflows\n",

    "## 🎓 Congratulations! You're Now an Agent Routing Expert!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Mastered:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Hierarchical Agent Architecture:**\n",
    "- AzureAIAgent for specialized, stateful base agents\n",
    "- ChatCompletionAgent for lightweight routing and orchestration\n",
    "- Multi-level agent coordination patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Intelligent Routing:**\n",
    "- Domain-specific agent specialization\n",
    "- Query analysis and intelligent dispatch\n",
    "- Multi-agent coordination for complex queries\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Production Patterns:**\n",
    "- Proper resource management in complex systems\n",
    "- Error handling across agent hierarchies\n",
    "- Performance optimization for routing systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Routing Patterns:**\n",
    "1. **Conditional Routing**: Based on user context, preferences, or history\n",
    "2. **Load Balancing**: Multiple instances of the same specialist type\n",
    "3. **Fallback Chains**: Graceful degradation when specialists are unavailable\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Agent Creation**: Creating specialists on-demand\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enterprise Integration:**\n",
    "- Authentication and authorization across agent hierarchies\n",
    "- Monitoring and observability for routing decisions\n",
    "- Cost optimization through intelligent agent utilization\n",
    "- A/B testing different routing strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Architectural Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use AzureAIAgent vs ChatCompletionAgent:**\n",
    "- **AzureAIAgent**: Complex workflows, state management, persistent conversations\n",
    "- **ChatCompletionAgent**: Fast decisions, routing logic, stateless operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling Patterns:**\n",
    "- Start with simple 1-to-many routing\n",
    "- Add coordination layers for complex workflows\n",
    "- Implement caching and optimization as you scale\n",
    "\n",
    "**Happy routing with Azure AI Agents!** 🎉\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Quick Troubleshooting Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "**Routing Issues:**\n",
    "- Verify agent instructions are clear and domain-specific\n",
    "- Check plugin integration for base agents\n",
    "- Test individual agents before building hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Issues:**\n",
    "- Monitor routing decision time vs. specialist execution time\n",
    "- Consider caching for repeated routing patterns\n",
    "- Use async operations throughout the hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Management:**\n",
    "- Track token usage across multiple agents\n",
    "- Implement query optimization to reduce unnecessary calls\n",
    "- Clean up agents promptly to avoid ongoing charges"
