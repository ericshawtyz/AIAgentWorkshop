    "This tutorial shows you how to orchestrate multiple **Azure AI Agents** working together using Semantic Kernel, both **sequentially** and **concurrently**!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential Orchestration** - Azure AI Agents working one after another in a pipeline\n",
    "2. **Concurrent Orchestration** - Multiple Azure AI Agents working simultaneously\n",
    "3. **Agent Specialization** - Creating specialized Azure AI Agents with unique plugins\n",
    "4. **Workflow Patterns** - Real-world orchestration scenarios with Azure AI Agents\n",
    "5. **Performance Optimization** - When to use concurrent vs sequential patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Configuration:**\n",
    "- Uses **Azure AI Agents** (not ChatCompletionAgent)\n",
    "- Uses **AzureChatCompletion** service (not OpenAIChatCompletion)\n",
    "- Automatically configures Azure OpenAI connection using environment variables\n",
    "- Compatible with Azure AI Studio deployments\n",

    "- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple Azure AI Agents work simultaneously ‚ö°\n",
    "- **Better Results**: Domain experts produce higher quality outputs üìà\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Add more Azure AI Agents as needed üîÑ\n",
    "- **Resilience**: If one agent fails, others continue üí™\n",

    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Design Principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Azure AI Agent Specialization**\n",
    "   - Give each Azure AI Agent a clear, focused role\n",
    "   - Create specialized plugins for domain expertise\n",
    "   - Write specific instructions for each Azure AI Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Handling**\n",
    "   - Always implement proper cleanup (Azure AI Agents are managed)\n",
    "   - Handle agent failures gracefully\n",
    "   - Provide fallback strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance Optimization**\n",
    "   - Use concurrent patterns for independent tasks\n",
    "   - Use sequential patterns for dependent workflows\n",
    "   - Monitor execution times and optimize bottlenecks\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resource Management**\n",
    "   - Azure AI Agents are managed by Azure (no manual cleanup needed)\n",
    "   - Monitor Azure AI service usage and costs\n",
    "   - Implement timeouts for long-running operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîí Security Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Privacy**\n",
    "   - Don't log sensitive information\n",
    "   - Implement data retention policies\n",
    "   - Use secure communication between Azure AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access Control**\n",
    "   - Use DefaultAzureCredential for secure authentication\n",
    "   - Limit Azure AI Agent permissions appropriately\n",
    "   - Validate all inputs to plugins\n",
    "   - Monitor Azure AI Agent activities\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä Monitoring and Debugging:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logging**\n",
    "   - Log Azure AI Agent interactions and decisions\n",
    "   - Track execution times and performance metrics\n",
    "   - Monitor plugin function calls\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Testing**\n",
    "   - Test individual Azure AI Agents before orchestration\n",
    "   - Test orchestration patterns with various scenarios\n",
    "   - Implement automated testing for critical workflows"
